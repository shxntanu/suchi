# deploy/

Starting points for common self-hosted deployments.

Everything here is a starting point — edit the hostname, TLS paths,
and storage locations before you paste them into production. Moving image tags
such as `beta` are evaluation defaults only. Production deployments must use
the published image digest for the selected release; this also applies to any
server exposed to the mobile app.

| Directory | What it is |
| --------- | ---------- |
| [`compose.yaml`](../compose.yaml) | Minimal single-container Compose deployment. It binds to loopback by default; start here when you want editable mounts, networks, or image pins. |
| [`systemd/`](systemd/suchi.service) | Unit file for a bare-binary install on a Linux host. Runs suchi as an unprivileged user with the usual defense-in-depth sandboxing. |
| [`caddy/`](caddy/Caddyfile) | Reverse-proxy snippet for Caddy. Auto-TLS via Let's Encrypt when the site block uses a real hostname. |
| [`nginx/`](nginx/suchi.conf) | Server block for nginx. Assumes certificates already exist at the paths shown — provision them however you already do. |
| [`traefik/`](traefik/) | Dynamic-config snippet for Traefik. Assumes an existing `websecure` entrypoint and cert resolver. |
| [`k8s/`](k8s/) | Single-replica Deployment + PVC + ClusterIP Service. **SQLite is single-writer** — do not scale replicas up. |
| [`render/`](render/README.md) | Render deployment notes for optional Turso remote SQL metadata and the separate file-durability requirements. |
| [`mail-mbsync/`](mail-mbsync/) | The mail-intake sidecar reference deployment. Docker Compose flavor. |

All shapes assume the same three env vars are set on suchi:

Optional [Google Drive storage](../docs/google-drive-storage.mdx) moves document
bytes to an owned Drive namespace. Keep a persistent `DATA_DIR` for SQLite and
keys, one server process, and temporary disk capacity for concurrent transfers.
Physical document views default off with Drive; enabling them retains complete
local copies. Render-specific requirements are in the [Render guide](render/README.md).

- `DATA_DIR` — where the SQLite database (when local mode is selected), CAS blobs, and rendered
  views live. Must be writable by the suchi process.
- `LISTEN_ADDR` — usually `127.0.0.1:8000` behind a reverse proxy, or
  `0.0.0.0:8000` inside a container.
- `PUBLIC_URL` — the absolute URL users open. Suchi uses it for secure-cookie
  behavior, OIDC callbacks, and generated share links.

Keep a local evaluation port on loopback. A remotely reachable deployment
needs an HTTPS reverse proxy or Ingress, and its Suchi image must be pinned by
digest.

Full env-var and config-file reference: [docs/config.mdx](../docs/config.mdx).

## Additional operations

- NAS platforms can run the Docker image without a platform-specific template;
  map persistent storage to `/data` and keep a single application replica.
- Suchi creates periodic database snapshots, but complete recovery also needs
  blobs and keys. Follow [Backup and restore](../docs/backup-restore.mdx).
- Suchi writes structured logs to stderr for journald, Docker log drivers, or
  cluster collectors.
