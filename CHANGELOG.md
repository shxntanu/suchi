# Changelog

Notable user-visible changes to Suchi are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]
### Added

- Add optional Google Drive storage for immutable originals and derived bytes,
  with verified seekable working files and local SQLite/credential keys.
- Add read-only Aether-to-import-bundle migration and an offline verified
  local-to-Drive storage transfer. Drive uses its own blob namespace.
- Add configurable physical document views, defaulting off with Drive to
  avoid retaining a complete local copy of the document archive.

### Fixed

- Accept app-visible Aether/Suchi children as parent-folder access evidence
  when narrow Drive credentials hide the parent metadata with a 404.
- Enumerate private Drive markers from paginated folder metadata instead of
  key-only queries, and classify recognized 400 errors without exposing raw
  provider messages.
- Repair rendered links created by beta.1 and beta.2 when a stable-v1 refile
  verifies that the linked blob belongs to the document.
- Keep operational dead-job details and the Retry/Dismiss recovery controls out
  of member Approvals; administrators retain the audited recovery controls.


## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Add a Documents filter for files currently available through an active share
  link created by the signed-in user.
- Add a standalone Filing tree workspace with canonical Solo, Household,
  Freelance, and Small business trees; a five-lane set composer; reviewed
  category mappings with document counts; and in-place preset transitions that
  preserve filing IDs and local rule forks. Solo and Household use four focused
  lanes; all four trees call their money-management lane Money and omit generic
  Banking and broad “records” catch-alls. Purpose-specific names distinguish
  Collections & aging, Briefs & plans, Approvals & sign-off, and Medical billing.
- Add self-service sign-in email changes under **My account**: local users
  reauthenticate with their password, while OIDC users force a provider
  reauthentication. Changes are immediate without confirmation/recovery mail,
  preserve the account's documents and permissions, revoke old browser sessions,
  and rotate the current browser.

### Changed

- Start the stable database epoch from one declarative schema-1 baseline.
  Canonical fingerprints admit beta.1, beta.2, beta.3, and pre-identity schema
  4; each beta archive is snapshotted mode 0600 and adopted atomically through
  compatibility migration 0005. The migration preserves numeric user IDs,
  extension DDL, correspondent revisions and all dependent references while
  adding stable OIDC identity, a development-account marker and retained
  security-audit metadata. It resolves watched-folder ownership to a user ID,
  moves legacy singular correspondents into role-bearing relations, removes
  empty obsolete schema, and prunes successful jobs older than seven days.
  Unknown, partial, prior untagged-0005 and already-adopted old stable
  fingerprints fail before mutation. Operators with an already-adopted
  pre-identity archive must follow the reviewed
  quiescent-backup/manual-0005 path. Existing unbound OIDC accounts require a
  preserved live session for explicit provider binding.
- Keep watched-folder ownership attached to a durable user ID across account
  email changes. Identity changes no longer rewrite or reload watcher settings;
  owner-based custom storage paths rerender in the identity transaction.
- Treat all correspondent reads and writes as ordered, role-bearing relations.
  Singular sender edits promote or clear only the sender role, while explicit
  multi-party edits retain recipients, CCs and other relations.
- Hide successful background jobs from default task lists and counts, retain
  explicit completed results for seven days, and prune them in the existing
  dispatcher loop.
- Limit API-token last-use telemetry to one database write per token per hour.

### Fixed

- Bring a completed filing-tree review into view with focus and a brief visual
  cue, and remove the internal preview hash from the review header.
- Preview filing-tree transitions against the categories actually present, so
  archives created with older preset revisions do not submit invalid
  replacement codes.
- Upgrade existing beta.3 archives before querying filing-rule suspension, so
  opening the Filing tree no longer fails with a missing `suspended` column.
- Adopt historical schema-3 archives left by pre-beta mutable baselines, while
  refusing to discard any configured obsolete agent webhooks.
- Keep full-width Documents search above one options row, combine added-date
  bounds behind **Any date**, and separate left-side filters from right-side
  display, refresh and sorting controls. Remove duplicate Trash and tag-catalog
  controls from the list toolbar.
- Display every date picker with stable ISO `yyyy-mm-dd` input, including the
  date portion of mailbox sync timestamps.
- Cancel superseded document-change approvals when metadata changes and during
  the existing approval sweep, so obsolete suggestions leave the review queue.
- Remove repetitive review guidance and score disclaimers from approval cards.
- Return success for every CLI help request, bypass runtime configuration while
  printing help, and enumerate all taxonomy child commands.
- Treat a matching blob installed by a concurrent writer as successful
  deduplication when Windows refuses to replace the destination.
- Support HTTP byte ranges for authenticated and public-share document
  downloads without bypassing their authorization checks.
- Make the restore and AnyDoc ingestion drills run on macOS as well as Linux
  by using the system temporary directory and portable shell utilities.
- Make benchmark threshold mode Linux-only and fail when its required idle RSS
  measurement is missing instead of silently skipping the guardrail.
- Correct container build documentation: pinned base images and verified sources
  bound major inputs, while live distro package repositories prevent a source
  tag from guaranteeing a byte-identical rebuild.
- Report configured, available, and missing Tesseract language packs in
  `suchi doctor`, with operator steps for installing and verifying extra packs.

### Security

- Give every built-in SQLite snapshot an exclusive mode-0600 filename and a
  manifest SHA-256. Guarded restore requires manifest membership, rejects
  traversal and corruption, fsyncs a temporary copy, atomically replaces the
  database, and removes stale WAL sidecars.
- Bind OIDC accounts by verified issuer/subject instead of mutable email.
  Browser callbacks alone can provision an unused verified email; Bearer
  authentication is resolution-only and collisions never merge accounts.
  Purpose-bound signed transactions use PKCE and nonce verification, identity
  changes require a retained audit row, and all browser sessions rotate while
  API/mobile tokens remain valid.
- Reject reserved development/demo identities at every public account boundary,
  durably mark development-seeded administrators, and refuse normal startup
  while an enabled marked or legacy public-credential administrator remains.
- Make capability audit insertion part of the user-update transaction, so an
  audit failure rolls back the capability change and dependent revocations.
- Publish native takeouts atomically with mode-0600 permissions, preserve
  existing destinations unless `--force` is explicit, reject outputs inside
  `DATA_DIR`, require unambiguous owner scope, and fail on missing originals
  unless recovery uses `--allow-incomplete`.
- Upgrade `golang.org/x/crypto` to 0.56.0, which fixes the SSH channel
  deadlock advisories. Record the sole remaining module-only advisory for the
  unimported, unmaintained `openpgp` package.

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Add HuML/TOML filing-tree preview, import, merge, and tree-only export. The first
  prefixed import creates permanent A00–Z99 filing systems, memberships,
  `SYS.AC.documentID` addresses, and a recoverable `00.00 archive.huml` index.
- Add the pre-release Companion contract: five-minute single-use pairing, bound
  filing-system identity, compatibility/scopes discovery, idempotent document
  and version uploads, device OCR provenance, split-origin lookup, metadata reads,
  bounded thumbnails, and device revocation.
- Add type-to-select existing tags in document detail and bulk assignment on
  Documents. Admin **Manage tags** links open one searchable Settings catalog,
  with confirmed multi-tag deletion; saved-view editing and password-unlocked
  state also appear in document lists and detail.
- Add explicit application assembly through `distro/app.Run`, independently
  checksummed extension migrations, and an instance-owned automation-action
  registry. Compiled distributions can register native routes and durable
  subscribers before workers or the listener start; unlisted routes remain
  session-only.

### Changed

- Resolve classifier-created `needs-review` when a person edits document
  metadata through PATCH or bulk metadata/tag actions. The removal commits
  with the edit; manual review tags and explicit reassertions remain, while
  Trash, restore and rescan alone do not clear review.
- Upgrade beta.2 archives directly to beta.3/schema 3 after taking a complete
  backup of SQLite, blobs, the credential key, and configuration. Stable v1 will
  accept both beta.2 and beta.3 archives directly; retain the backup and beta.3
  release artifacts until that upgrade is verified.
- Apply high-confidence inferred dates, model metadata, and local archive matches
  by default, with review-first mode available. Suggestions remain bound to
  source and field generations; review and queued application recheck the current
  session, permissions, supporting documents, human edits, and explicit clears.
- Make Archive Configuration the sole administration surface. Selecting a preset,
  importing a tree, or explicitly choosing Blank is the only required archive
  setup step; the Filing tree reminder persists across navigation and reloads,
  while every ordinary setting remains available beforehand.
- Ship all unreleased database work in migration 0003 without changing published
  beta.2 migrations 0001/0002. Fresh and populated schema-2 archives advance to
  schema 3 with preserved IDs, history, credentials, and a one-row
  `final-beta-schema-3` marker. Stable v1 uses a squashed fresh-install baseline
  and guarded compatibility paths so users can upgrade directly from beta.2 or
  beta.3 without installing an intermediate release.
- Define strict offline `suchi-taxonomy/v1`; reject YAML and unsupported fields,
  merge later presets/imports additively, keep refile explicit, and place rendered
  projections under immutable per-system roots. Native takeout v2 remains a
  selected-system export rather than a complete backup.
- Publish versioned images without moving aliases, then promote stable/beta/RC
  aliases only after signing, SBOM collection, and the GitHub release succeed.
  Release runs are serialized, and dispatch verifies that the GitHub annotated
  tag peels to the local commit.
- Make automatic **Processing update** approval reminders a checked-in,
  per-pipeline release policy. New proposal revisions are default-off and fully
  determined by the release tag; existing reminders and explicit rescans remain
  available.
- Reuse verified AnyDoc artifacts and avoid unnecessary thumbnail decoding and
  document-detail reloads.

### Fixed

- Preserve literal SQLite filenames, archive isolation, taxonomy descriptions,
  disabled or forked rules, symbolic filters, filing identity, and existing
  Trash timestamps. Conflicts fail before partial taxonomy or seed changes.
- Recover owned rendered links after archive changes and restarts without
  overwriting unrelated files or letting purged links reappear.
- Preserve sensitivity in new versions and current parent metadata in split
  scans; stop extraction-created children after Trash; enforce restore limits and
  reject custom-field edits on trashed documents.
- Bind approval decisions and retries to their originating review, prevent
  duplicate effects and reopened expired reviews, recover only provable beta.2
  work, release the writer after callback panics, and expose only bounded producer
  provenance with the same owner-level source checks used at application.
- Keep upload, download, pairing, document-save, and Trash operations bound to
  their original actor and filing system. Fix demo startup, streamed refile
  options, account-tool visibility, avatar refresh, settings scrollbar clearance,
  email-rule resizing, and QR alignment.
- Keep child tags when deleting their parent (including on already-applied
  schema-3 archives), and make selected-system multi-tag deletion atomic.

### Security

- Enforce filing-system selection, token binding, membership, scopes, and document
  ACLs across reads, counts, search, tasks, research, blobs, versions, uploads,
  and Trash. Administrator privilege never bypasses an explicit token boundary.
- Bind OAuth and mobile pairing to the actor and filing system. Membership removal
  atomically revokes shares, tokens, and pairings; pairing validates public origins
  and consumes each code with token issuance.
- Prevent self-disable and last-administrator removal, recheck authority after
  password hashing, normalize role capabilities, and commit dependent revocations
  with account changes.
- Rate-limit every credential alias and cap all concurrent Argon2 hashing and
  verification across account creation, shares, login, and token checks.
  Cross-site anonymous session creation, including headerless form posts and
  decoded API slash aliases, is refused before routing.
- Revalidate authenticated blobs and thumbnails on every browser reuse so logout,
  account changes, ACL revocation, document state, and sensitivity gates take
  effect before a cached response is reused. Public share metadata, unlock
  responses, and downloads are `no-store` so revocation, expiry, and password
  changes cannot be bypassed by a browser or intermediary cache.
- Pin the built-in demo corpus to its compiled SHA-256, resolve custom sidecars
  before reuse, and never retain a verified marker across unverified replacements.
  Confine manifest fixtures to already-opened regular files under `fixtures/`,
  rejecting path traversal and non-regular files.
- Keep extension migrations in separate checksummed ledgers and reject steps that
  change core `PRAGMA user_version`.
- Separate browser sessions from headless token exchange, constrain development
  credentials to explicitly safe listeners, and retain request IDs and security
  headers on rejections.

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Screenshot paste previews with explicit upload confirmation and file-picker
  fallback, using the same upload path as drag-and-drop.
- Full extracted-text reading and copying, including manual copy fallback and
  the existing sensitive-document reveal gate.
- Local `.ics` downloads for reviewed exact-day Calendar entries, with explicit
  export disclosure and private source-document links.
- Browser-local QR codes for opening private documents on a phone and for
  existing document or selection share links, with ordinary copy fallbacks.
- One bounded rich query language across ranked search, Documents, the
  omnibox, and new saved views, with text prefixes, phrases, negation,
  filing metadata, dates, document state, qualifier suggestions, and
  apply-time validation.
- A scoped Archive research desk with reauthorized follow-ups, structured
  citation validation, Views made from retrieved documents, bounded model
  traffic, and explicit sensitive-evidence consent.
- A generic extracted-fact ledger with single-call date extraction,
  user-controlled confidence-based Calendar entry, optional bulk review, and
  rich-query date filters.
- A first-visit public-demo guide for rich queries and source-backed Calendar
  dates, plus a persistent help launcher. Archive research is clearly marked
  private-installation-only; public model access remains denied.
- A fixed 30-day Trash recovery window with automatic expiry, confirmed
  permanent deletion and Empty Trash actions, share-link revocation, minimal
  purge auditing. Original and derived blobs remain until offline GC; online
  cleanup cannot safely identify in-flight uploads reusing those bytes.

### Changed

- Small document controls share one deferred bundle, reducing document-screen
  requests without loading administration or QR encoding on the initial page.
  Production-browser tests now exercise generated assets through local preview.
- Upload receipts distinguish new, duplicate, restored and failed files, and
  retain honest processing state when automatic status checks pause.
- Settings displays the release version in production. Development builds
  identify the source version line and revision, or explicitly unavailable metadata.
- OCR language documentation now covers installing packs in both Docker variants
  and bare-metal deployments, verifying model discovery, configuration precedence
  and rescanning existing documents.
- The web app imports screens directly and defers archive/mailbox configuration,
  removing six route wrappers. At the same dependency pins, Documents loads 48%
  less route JavaScript, Upload 83% less, and My account without mailbox access
  86% less. Finer chunks increase the all-routes compressed total by 8.3%.
- `doctor` drops a misleading shard-capacity sample whose threshold cannot
  occur in the hash-prefix layout. Explicit CAS integrity checks are unchanged.
- Reviewed tool and dependency pins advance to compatible previous-stable
  releases, including Go 1.27.0, Bun 1.4.1, AnyDoc 0.2.3, and SQLite 1.57.
  CI actions use immutable commits, and AnyDoc builds honor its Cargo lockfile.
- Release preflight now includes fresh code/UI checks and advisory scans.
  Artifacts-only branch builds use legal snapshot names and skip signing;
  image publication waits for the binary builds.
- Ready jobs and follow-up pipeline stages drain without a polling delay
  between batches. Document lists load correspondent names in one query.
- The web app reuses its date formatter and removes redundant search state
  updates and request wrappers.
- Beta.2 schema changes now ship as one migration, so beta.1 archives advance
  in a single transactional step.
- Rich-query lists now start from matching FTS rows, ranked Search bounds
  recency snippet work to its result page, and newest document pages use a
  stable partial index.
- Bulk document authorization is batched, and concurrent date reviewers now
  report and audit only the decision that actually changed each candidate.
- The web app cancels superseded list, search, Calendar, and completion reads;
  caches Calendar date formatters; loads route CSS lazily; and retains at most
  20 Archive research turns.
- Sampled rescans keep memory proportional to the requested sample, idle
  research rate entries expire, and date extraction holds SQLite's writer for
  less time.

### Fixed

- Dismissed processing-update approvals no longer reappear after restart for
  the same pipeline revision. Startup closes already-recreated duplicates while
  preserving explicitly approved work and prompts for newer revisions.
- Public demo Calendar now exposes read-only, source-backed example dates
  across months and years. The tour links to usable Search and Calendar screens
  and clearly identifies Archive research as private-installation-only;
  demo model calls, date mutations, and non-demo facts remain denied.
- Demo navigation and first-visit tour detection now use the server's actual
  session identity field, including after upgrade to a scratch session.
- Documents and Inbox preserve pagination through browser Back, Forward, and
  reload, with numbered page links and URL-backed date filters. Invalid or
  vanished pages return to an available page without adding a history entry.
- Touchscreen document links no longer shift under taps when hover-only quick
  actions appear; filing and Trash remain available in document detail.
- Preset filing keywords match whole words and phrases: `lease` no longer
  matches `please`. Existing unchanged preset rules receive the same correction.
- Filing approvals close as superseded when a document has already been filed
  elsewhere, preserving its current category and recording the dismissal.
- Email backfills fetch small, checkpointed batches instead of one oversized
  IMAP command, preserving completed progress when a later batch fails.
- Successful mailbox connection tests no longer hide ingestion errors or
  overwrite the last successful sync timestamp.
- Successful confident classification clears only its own obsolete review tags.
  Existing, manually assigned and rule-maintained tags remain untouched.
- Photo OCR keeps its normal text and supplements it with confident lines from
  one bounded sparse-text pass, recovering isolated headings without replacing
  invoice text or changing ordinary PDF OCR. Low-confidence and short background
  noise is filtered; curved labels and perspective can still limit recognition.
- Difficult photographed QR codes now get a bounded local ZBar fallback when
  the Go reader cannot decode them; both runtime images include the tool.
- Lightweight OCR retries empty pages once using sparse-text segmentation for
  isolated labels. Rasterization, pages and retries share one real timeout, and
  cancellation/output-limit failures cannot be recorded as successful empty OCR.
  OCR revision 2 offers the existing controlled rescan path for older results.
- Camera photos retain their EXIF orientation in generated PDFs. Raster images
  use 300-DPI page density without changing pixel resolution, preventing the
  OCR stage from enlarging ordinary phone photos into hundreds of megapixels.
  Content remains at revision 2; selected rescans repair older results from
  immutable originals. Rescan prompts omit internal revision numbers.
- Approval cards omit internal workflow names, assignee IDs and step metadata.
  Decisions retain confidence, evidence and deadlines; rescan proposals list
  their affected documents under an explicit label.
- Created share links remain visible and selectable when clipboard access is
  unavailable. Copy can be retried without creating another link; delayed
  creation responses cannot copy links after account or document navigation.
- Startup rejects duplicate or invalid migration versions before changing any
  schema, identifying the conflicting migrations for developers.
- Dropping files onto the upload dialog submits each file once. Uploads dropped
  elsewhere refresh the visible document list immediately.
- Trash documents open in the existing viewer with read-only metadata and
  owner/admin preview, download, restore, and confirmed permanent deletion.
  Mobile rows keep document titles above their actions; sensitive reveal gates
  and public-share exclusions remain in place.
- Archive research opens its retrieved documents' Calendar dates in an all-dates
  agenda across months and years, with explicit scope and pagination. New date
  links clear stale Calendar filters; the ordinary Calendar stays month-based.
  Partial dates no longer display invented days in Calendar or Approvals;
  Calendar keeps labeled model confidence behind Automatic/Reviewed details.
- Calendar day links open paginated exact-day agendas, retain the month, View,
  and role in the URL, and return to the originating month. Server-side precision
  filtering excludes month/year placeholders before counting or pagination.
- Archive research allows a bounded 4,096-token generation budget so reasoning
  models can finish their JSON answer. Truncation has a distinct error; citation
  validation and the 6,000-character answer limit remain unchanged. Failure logs
  include fixed diagnostic reasons without question, evidence, or provider text.
- Settings identifies the running server version and source revision for bug
  reports. JSON API errors retain their codes even with mislabeled response
  headers, so Archive research can show the relevant failure message.
- Mail attachments with invalid or generic MIME headers are identified from
  their bytes. Explicit rescans repair existing PDFs labeled as binary files
  and restore preview and password handling without changing originals.
- Both container variants now produce real PDFs from images, including HEIC:
  standard includes the missing ImageMagick PDF encoder, and full permits PDF
  writing while keeping decoding restricted. The duplicate HEIC conversion
  path is gone; non-PDF converter output is rejected. Explicitly rescan affected
  images to repair older results; pipeline revisions and originals stay intact.
- Mail smoke checks wait for ingestion, verify OCR text and parse the downloaded
  HEIC archive instead of accepting any non-null blob or a fragile log match.
- Demo visitor expiry also leaves CAS bytes for offline reclamation, preventing
  it from removing an in-flight upload or another document version's original.
  The existing stopped demo-volume reset remains the disk-reclamation path.
- Setup, egress, and filing-recovery logs preserve their structured event name
  instead of emitting duplicate JSON `msg` fields.
- Demo dashboard counts now include the visible corpus. Visitor uploads preview
  and download through the same bounded session after navigation or reload.
- Destructive confirmation dialogs use native modal focus, Escape handling,
  and an inert background, restoring focus when cancelled.
- Permanent deletion no longer removes an in-flight upload's original bytes.
  GC now explicitly requires stopped archive writers, and the restore drill
  verifies a real document's bytes, extracted content, and search after restart.
- Clearing Search cancels its pending request and resets loading/error state.
- Replaying a demo manifest skips existing documents without adding tags or
  jobs to an unrelated document.
- Approvals bound to trashed documents now disappear from REST and MCP inboxes;
  restoring the document makes them available again only if the task and its
  run are still active.
- Calendar collapses same-document same-day roles into one month-grid card,
  keeps origin badges inside compact cards, and mobile document rows prioritize
  titles over tags.
- Dashboard recent documents load once per navigation instead of retriggering
  from their own response state.
- Calendar resolves an owned or shared saved View by ID on the server, applies
  its complete filter, and then reapplies document ACLs.
- Archive research requests provider JSON mode, normalizes structured citations
  into clickable answer markers, tolerates numeric citation strings, includes
  receipt totals in bounded evidence passages, and logs only the mode, passage
  and source counts, and bounded evidence size—never question or document text.
- Date review uses a responsive document grid, keeps the selected-date actions
  visible, explains the decision, and renders section labels in sentence case.
- Title-only ranked matches return an empty body snippet instead of failing,
  Calendar identifies months that exceed its 500-row display limit, and
  oversized facet lists fail before reaching SQLite.
- HTTP request metrics now record the matched route pattern, including
  normalized API paths, without using document IDs as labels.

### Security

- MCP refuses redirects, malformed or oversized responses, and unexpected
  content types. Tool errors omit document queries, response bodies and raw
  transport diagnostics.
- Browser demo credentials no longer live in JavaScript storage. Scratch
  sessions retain their restricted identity, expire at the visitor TTL, and
  enforce same-origin mutation checks; concurrent writes share one upgrade.
- Both OIDC sign-in paths now require signed verified-email claims before
  binding local accounts. Providers without truthful `email_verified: true`
  claims are no longer supported. Suchi Bearer tokens work with OIDC enabled,
  and unknown credentials cannot fall back to a browser session.
- Share-link bearers are no longer copied into creation audit events or HTTP
  access logs. Logs and metrics retain matched routes across authentication.
- Signing out clears retained archive data; delayed reads, profile refreshes,
  demo upgrades, and queued uploads cannot carry work into another account.
- Mail and AnyDoc smoke checks now own isolated temporary data and containers,
  bind loopback, and retain scratch data if teardown fails.
- API tokens now enforce a fail-closed route policy. Narrow document/event
  tokens cannot inherit account/settings administration from an admin owner;
  profiling and raw-original downloads require a session. Token management is
  session-only, removing token delegation and cross-user credential revocation
  through narrow admin tokens. Admin-token metrics remain supported.
- Model-provider logs retain only the endpoint host, never URL paths or query
  strings that may contain tenant or credential material.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- A local-first document archive in one Go binary, with an embedded web app,
  SQLite storage, full-text search, metadata, versions, and filing trees.
- Browser, API, watched-folder, and rules-based IMAP intake, including Microsoft
  sign-in, app-password providers, and Paperless-ngx bundle import.
- Ready-made filing trees, deterministic automations, optional local or hosted
  classification, approvals, and permanent Archive configuration.
- Source history, saved and shared views, secure email previews, document
  sharing, API tokens, MCP access, and multi-user permissions.

### Changed

- Fresh installations start with only System/Inbox and require an explicit
  filing-tree or Blank choice; setup controls remain available afterward.
- Account and archive configuration have separate workspaces, with one home for
  mailbox, automation, taxonomy, and saved-view actions.
- Duplicate content records each distinct source, explicit configuration stays
  authoritative, and inactive interface work is deferred for faster navigation.

### Fixed

- Mail intake advances ignored messages correctly, filters only ingestible
  attachments, and no longer leaves attachment-only source emails in Trash.
- Setup reminders retire after engagement, filing-tree selection, completion,
  or 48 hours instead of blocking Archive configuration indefinitely.
- Access checks now cover every document action; Confidential and Restricted
  thumbnails, previews, and extracted text share the same reveal protection.
- Filing-tree replacement, classification, polling, ingest jobs, taxonomy
  import, and configuration reloads preserve state and recover cleanly.
- Saved-view links, missing thumbnails, fast route changes, pipeline rescans,
  and password-protected documents no longer produce misleading interface state.

### Security

- Session and token secrets are digested; provider keys, mailbox credentials,
  and saved document passwords are sealed at rest.
- Setup, demo isolation, error responses, and capability removal fail closed.
